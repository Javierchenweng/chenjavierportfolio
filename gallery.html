    <p>Title: I Am a Bunny Gamer</p>
        <p>Semester/Year: Fall 2019</p>
        <p>Software: Adobe Photoshop 2018
        <p>Description: The idea is to put my face on a rabbit because I was born in 1999, and in the Chinese calendar the year 1999 was the year of the rabbit. In addition, the background is a video game set-up because I like and enjoy playing video games.</p>

        <p>Semester/Year: Fall 2019</p>
        <p>Software: Adobe Photoshop 2018</p>
        <p>Description: One day the human head escaped from the bunny. The bunny became sad and started chasing “his” head around the room. After some time trying to catch the head without succeeding, the bunny became really angry and decided to eliminate the head with a powerful power. That gave the bunny peace and a smile in his face.</p>

    <p>Title: A Hero vs a Villain</p>
        <p>Semester/Year: Fall 2019</p>
        <p>Software: Audacity</p>
        <p>Description: I interpret both hero and villain in this audio project by using a voice changer app to get a more accurate voice of the characters.</p>
        
<p>A small village is being attacked by a villain, people screaming and running for their lives through destroyed buildings by explosions, and the villain`s malefic laugh. Moments later, a hero comes in to save the day. The hero is a tiny but powerful individual, never underestimate him! But that is what the villain did. It ended up being the worst mistake of his life, it cost him his life!</p> 

<p>The hero tries to have a peaceful conversation with the villain to get to a non-violent conclusion, but the villain only wants to kill people. That must not be allow! And the hero does what he has to do.</p>
        <p>CREDITS: I created the audio project using the search engine for creative commons audio files. I downloaded the audio files from the following websites:</p>
        <p>Music from: <a href="https://soundcloud.com/">https://soundcloud.com/</a></p>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">https://www.youtube.com/</a>

        <p>Title: I Want That Carrot!!!</p>
        <p>Semester/Year: Fall 2019</p>
        <p>Software: Adobe After Effects 2018</p>
        <p>Description: Everything (the shapes and effects) in this project is made from after effects, except for the rabbit. The rabbit is from the first project in Photoshop.</p>
        <p>I use text and a wide variety of key frames and effects. Key frames, such as scale, position, opacity, etc. and effects like, radio wave for the sun and wave warp for water. In addition, the background is made with a gradient effect that has green for the ground and blue for the sky, which is changing gradually to give the impression of the dawn, day time, and night time.</p>
        <p>This project is about a rabbit that sees a huge carrot and goes for it spending the entire day walking up and down in the mountains. He finally gets to the carrot at evening. The rabbit eats the gigantic carrot, which makes him huge afterward.</p>
